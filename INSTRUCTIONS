If you guys want instructions on how to add a file to repository, how to fork and other features of github just message me and I will help you out.
Just be sure to add your code where it belongs and I will allow most of your commits regularly.
Don't nag me with every commit you make, if your commit does not show up, wait for some time and I will pass it eventually, I will do them asap but I am not availabe 24X7 and you need to respect that
Addition of new folders is strictly prohibited, if you want something like that added, message me and I will review it whether to add or not.
